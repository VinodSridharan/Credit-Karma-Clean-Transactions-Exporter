### Defense‑in‑Depth for Code Quality & Security

This project treats security and correctness as first‑class features:

- 🧹 **ESLint‑clean codebase** – The entire extension passes ESLint with 0 errors and 0 warnings using a security‑aware rule set (strict equality, no eval/implied eval, unused symbol cleanup, etc.).
- 🛰️ **Static analysis pipeline** – SonarLint is wired into the editor and SonarCloud is integrated via GitHub Actions for deeper security and maintainability checks (a separate RCA documents a current SonarCloud LOC indexing issue).
- 🛡️ **Hardened message handling** – All `chrome.runtime.onMessage` handlers validate the sender origin and strictly validate date parameters (format, validity, and reasonable range) before any work is performed.
- 🧼 **Sanitized logging and alerts** – URLs are scrubbed before logging, and user‑facing error messages avoid exposing full URLs, tokens, or internal diagnostics.
- 🧾 **Documented security posture** – See [`SECURITY_NOTES.md`](./SECURITY_NOTES.md) for permissions analysis, data‑handling guarantees, and quality tooling, and [`docs/ROOT_CAUSE_SONARCLOUD_ZERO_LOC.md`](./docs/ROOT_CAUSE_SONARCLOUD_ZERO_LOC.md) for the SonarCloud root‑cause analysis.

These controls make TxVault suitable as a reference implementation for secure, auditable Chrome extensions that handle financial data.

## 📚 Lessons Learned & Challenges Overcome

### Key Challenges & Solutions

#### 1. Dynamic DOM Structure
**Challenge**: Credit Karma's transaction list uses dynamic DOM loading with no stable identifiers.

**Solution**: Implemented intelligent element selection using multiple fallback strategies:
- Primary: CSS selectors based on transaction card structure
- Fallback: XPath queries for complex nested structures
- Adaptive: Pattern matching for transaction data attributes

#### 2. Infinite Scroll & Lazy Loading
**Challenge**: Transactions load dynamically as user scrolls, requiring precise timing and scroll detection.

**Solution**: Developed boundary-first strategy:
- Find RIGHT boundary (first transaction after end date)
- Find LEFT boundary (last transaction before start date)
- Harvest data during boundary discovery
- Intelligent oscillation between boundaries

#### 3. Logout Triggers
**Challenge**: Aggressive scrolling or rapid DOM manipulation triggers Credit Karma's security, causing automatic logout.

**Solution**: Implemented time-critical design:
- Zero top scrolling (stays at current position)
- Intelligent delays between scroll actions
- Early exit on stagnation
- Auto-export on logout detection

#### 4. Date Format Variations
**Challenge**: Credit Karma displays dates in multiple formats (relative "2 days ago", absolute "Nov 27, 2025", pending transactions without dates).

**Solution**: Comprehensive date parsing:
- Relative date conversion (e.g., "2 days ago" → actual date)
- Multiple format handlers (MM/DD/YYYY, Month DD, YYYY, etc.)
- Pending transaction detection for current period presets
- Timezone-aware date comparison

#### 5. 100% Extraction Verification
**Challenge**: Proving that all transactions in a date range were captured without missing any.

**Solution**: Implemented PRISTINE verification system:
- Real-time progress tracking (expected vs harvested)
- Boundary verification (ensures complete date range coverage)
- Reference comparison (verified against manual exports)
- Status definitions (Pristine, Verified, Verified*)

#### 6. Transaction Deduplication
**Challenge**: Same transaction appearing multiple times during scrolling and oscillation phases.

**Solution**: Multi-layered deduplication:
- Hash-based tracking (transaction content hash)
- Data index tracking (Credit Karma's internal transaction IDs)
- Composite key matching (date + description + amount + type + status)
- Pre-export cleanup pass

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Session Timeouts for Large Presets

**Last Year** and other historical presets may encounter Credit Karma session timeouts (HTTP 401 errors) during long extraction runs (typically **15–25 minutes**).

**If this happens:**

- The extension will automatically export whatever partial data has been collected so far.
- The export summary will clearly show **"⚠️ Session timeout – may be incomplete"**.
- **What to do**: Refresh the Credit Karma page and re-run the preset.
- Data from multiple partial runs can be **merged in post‑processing** (for example with Python / Pandas).

**Best Practices:**

- Run the **Last Year** preset when you have a stable internet connection and 20–25 minutes available.
- Avoid running other **Credit Karma** tabs at the same time.
- If you see HTTP **401** errors in the console or in the export summary, wait **1–2 minutes** before retrying.

---

### Lessons learned: browser blockers

Some browser privacy tools and ad blockers can silently block key scripts on the Credit Karma site.  
When that happens, long TxVault exports may stall, show confusing internal errors, or stop early without a clean finish.  

To avoid this:

- Open your browser's privacy, shield, or ad‑block settings.  
- Add the Credit Karma site to the "ignore", "allowlist", or "trusted sites" list so scripts are not blocked there.  
- Then rerun TxVault; long exports are much less likely to hit random internal errors or timeouts.

## 📌 Note to Hiring Managers & Collaborators

If you’re reviewing this project as part of a hiring or collaboration process:

- This repository was used as a **sandbox for disciplined, end‑to‑end engineering**:
  - Problem discovery ➝ architecture ➝ implementation ➝ testing ➝ documentation ➝ security hardening.
  - Includes a written project review, root‑cause analysis of a third‑party tool issue, and a security notes document.
- The work here reflects how I like to build systems:
  - **Observable** – metrics, logs, and limitations are documented, not hidden.
