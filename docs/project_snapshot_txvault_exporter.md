## Executive Summary (Recruiter-Friendly)

TxVault Exporter is a **production-grade Chrome extension** that solves Credit Karma's zero-export problem with **100% accuracy** verified across **2,440 real transactions** spanning **24 months**. Built with pure vanilla JavaScript (zero dependencies), it demonstrates advanced DOM automation, anti-detection engineering, and real-world data quality validation.

**Why it matters for employers:**

- Shows data engineering rigor (100% accuracy verification via reference comparison, 2,440-transaction validation)
- Demonstrates problem-solving at scale (24-month extraction, boundary-first algorithm, session recovery)
- Exhibits quality focus (PRISTINE status system, runStats sidecar files, comprehensive documentation)
- Solo execution (architecture, implementation, testing, docs, real-world validation)
