# WhisperingChunks Legacy - Overlap Chunk Logic

This folder contains historical documentation for an earlier version of WhisperingChunks (pre-v0.2) that used overlap-based chunking logic for transcripts.

**Current WhisperingChunks repo (v0.2+):**

- Architecture: Archon-integrated RAG with "captures → clean" workflow (audio + text chunks consolidated into single documents with timestamp companions).

**This legacy version:**  
- Archived: December 16, 2025  
- Focus: Overlap-based chunk construction from series of transcript recordings.  
- Status: No longer in active development; preserved for historical reference.
