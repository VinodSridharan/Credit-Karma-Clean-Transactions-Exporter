---

### 2025-11-20: Version 3.0.4 - Critical Syntax Fix

**Major Capabilities Added:**
- ✅ **Critical Syntax Error Fix** - Fixed extra closing brace at line 1619 causing `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'catch'` at line 1620
- ✅ **Content Script Loading Restored** - Resolved syntax error that prevented entire content script from loading
- ✅ **"No Scroll" Issue Resolved** - Fixed root cause of "no scroll" symptom (script failing before execution)
- ✅ **Extension Functionality Restored** - All capabilities restored after critical syntax error fix
- ✅ **Finally Block Verification** - Verified `finally` block structure at line 2203 is correct (not orphaned)

**Root Cause:**
- Extra closing brace `}` at line 1619 prematurely closed the `try` block (started at line 1435)
- This made the `catch` block at line 1620 invalid syntax (no matching `try`)
- JavaScript parser failed before script could execute, causing complete extension failure

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed extra closing brace at line 1619
- Restored proper `try-catch` structure (try at line 1435, catch at line 1620)
- Verified `finally` block at line 2203 correctly closes outer try block (from line 1240)

**Impact:** Resolved critical issue that prevented extension from loading, restoring all capabilities. This was the root cause of the "no scroll" issue - the content script never loaded due to the syntax error.

---

### 2025-11-20: Enhanced Scroll-Back Mechanism

**Major Capabilities Added:**
- ✅ **Segmented Scroll-Back** - Gradual scroll-back to top (at least 33% per scroll) to avoid logout triggers
- ✅ **Human-Like Behavior** - Simulates natural scrolling patterns instead of direct jumps
- ✅ **Root Cause Documentation** - Documented logout trigger issue and segmented scroll solution
- ✅ **JavaScript & Python Implementation** - Applied to both extension and Selenium versions

**Impact:** Eliminated forced logout issues during transaction extraction, improving reliability.

---

### 2025-11-21: 100% Recovery Tracking & Parameter Optimization

**Major Capabilities Added:**
- ✅ **Recovery Tracking System** - Tracks when 100% recovery (133-140 transactions) is achieved
- ✅ **Parameter Capture** - Records scroll counts, wait times, and extraction parameters at 100% recovery
- ✅ **Reference Standard** - Uses October 133 transactions as reference for future optimizations
- ✅ **Optimization Avoidance** - Prevents unnecessary scrolling and time waste once 100% is achieved
- ✅ **JavaScript & Python Implementation** - Applied to both extension and Selenium versions

**Impact:** Enables future optimization by recording successful extraction parameters, reducing unnecessary scroll attempts.

---

### 2025-11-22: Enhanced Boundary Detection & Complete Month Verification

**Major Capabilities Added (Lessons Learned Implementation):**
- ✅ **Increased Buffer Scrolls** - Scroll 5 days past end date and 3 days before start date for Last Month preset
- ✅ **Complete Month Verification** - Requires 31 unique dates for October before stopping
- ✅ **Explicit Boundary Date Checks** - Verifies Oct 1 AND Oct 31 dates are present
- ✅ **Enhanced Segmented Scroll-Back** - Extracts transactions after EACH scroll segment during reverse scroll
- ✅ **Multi-Criteria Stop Condition** - Only stops when ALL criteria met:
  - Scrolled past both boundaries (5 days after, 3 days before)
  - Has explicit boundary dates (Oct 1 AND Oct 31)
  - Complete month coverage (31 unique dates)
  - Enough posted transactions (133+)
  - Date coverage (98%+)
- ✅ **Smaller Scroll Increments** - Uses 0.2x viewport height near boundaries for better lazy loading
- ✅ **Force Scroll Event Dispatch** - Triggers lazy loading more reliably

**Impact:** Addresses incomplete boundary detection that caused only 47 records (35%) instead of 133 for Last Month preset. Ensures full month coverage with all boundary dates captured.

---

### 2025-11-22: Centralized Configuration & Consistent Date Handling

**Major Capabilities Added:**
- ✅ **Centralized CONFIG Object** - All adjustable parameters organized at top of file (lines 15-56)
  - Expected transaction counts (EXPECTED_MIN/MAX)
  - Scroll configuration (MIN_SCROLLS for different ranges)
  - Boundary buffer days (BUFFER_DAYS for different range sizes)
  - Before-start buffer configuration
  - Coverage thresholds
  - Scroll wait times
- ✅ **System Date Collection** - SYSTEM_DATE captured once at start for consistency (line 1114)
- ✅ **Consistent Date Usage** - All `isLastMonth` calculations now use SYSTEM_DATE instead of multiple `new Date()` calls
- ✅ **CONFIG-Driven Logic** - Replaced hardcoded values with CONFIG parameters throughout code
- ✅ **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fixed SYSTEM_DATE captured but never used (8 locations updated)
  - Fixed hardcoded value `40` breaking CONFIG system (line 1788)

**Impact:** Ensures consistent date handling throughout extraction, prevents inconsistencies if extraction spans date boundaries, and maintains centralized configuration for easy parameter updates.

---

### 2025-11-22: Critical Syntax Fixes & Code Quality Verification

### 2025-11-26: Survey Scan Strategy & LastMonth‑Pristine Direction

**Context:** A later Last Month run reached the expected **133 posted October transactions** but required **21 minutes and 247 scrolls**, overshooting into July 2023 and then returning to November 2025 before finally stopping at the September boundary. This validated the robustness of the stop criteria but exposed logout‑risk and unnecessary deep scrolling for a single‑month preset.

**Key Decisions:**
- Treat any very deep first pass as a **survey scan**, not the standard Last Month path:
  - Harvest **all transactions** encountered as fast as possible, without per‑scroll in‑range/out‑of‑range decisions.
  - Build a `survey_statistics` CSV that aggregates **per‑date** and **per‑month** record counts (posted vs pending) so later passes can see how additional scrolls changed coverage.
- Keep the **MVP preset output** focused and pristine:
  - LastMonth‑Pristine export remains **posted‑only**, exact month range (e.g., Oct 1–31), with duplicate removal and strict date validation applied **at export time**.
  - Pending transactions in the band immediately preceding the first posted date are still harvested during the scan but excluded from the Last Month CSV.
- Introduce a **post‑survey upsell popup** in the UI:
  - After the MVP run completes, show: “Survey has observed X records up to boundary date Y. Do you want Last 3 Months / Last 6 Months / Last Year / Last 2 Years?” with clickable buttons.
  - Stay within the **already reached boundaries** where possible; show an explicit **logout‑risk warning** for long ranges (especially Last 2 Years).

**LastMonth‑Pristine Direction (Priority 1):**
- Design a **tight, single‑month scroll strategy** that:
  - Reaches the previous‑month band quickly and **does not drift** far beyond it (no mid‑August or 2023 excursions for an October target).
  - Continues to harvest everything it passes (including pending), but defers **all range filtering and posted‑only logic** to the export/filter phase.
  - Uses posted‑only coverage, complete date coverage, and a limited buffer below the month as stop criteria, with hard guards that block dangerously deep scrolling.

**Impact:** Aligns the project toward a **safe, fast LastMonth‑Pristine preset** and promotes the long 21‑minute scroll runs into a structured **survey + upsell** workflow instead of letting them be the default behavior.
